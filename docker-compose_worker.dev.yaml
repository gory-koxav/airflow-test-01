# Docker Compose Override for DEV Environment - Worker
# Workers connect to main server's Docker network (same machine)
#
# Shared Storage (DEV):
# - Uses local ./data folder from project directory
# - All containers (main + workers) share the same ./data folder
# - HOST_DATA_PATH=./data is set in env/dev/worker.env

networks:
  worker-network:
    # DEV: Connect to main server's network (same machine)
    external: true
    name: airflow-test-01_airflow-network

# DEV environment uses default volume configuration from docker-compose_worker.yaml
# which mounts ${HOST_DATA_PATH:-./data}:/opt/airflow/data
# Since HOST_DATA_PATH=./data in dev env, this becomes ./data:/opt/airflow/data
