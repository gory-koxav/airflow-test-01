# For production: main server runs control plane components
# Workers connect via external network (different servers)

# Port Configuration (Host ports - exposed for remote worker access)
# IMPORTANT: Ensure firewall allows these ports from worker IPs

# PROD: Use NFS mount from dedicated file server
# IMPORTANT: NFS must be mounted on the host before starting containers
#
# NFS File Server: 10.150.150.10
# NFS Export: /exports/airflow-data
# Local Mount Point: /mnt/airflow-data
#
# Mount command (run on host):
#   sudo mount -t nfs 10.150.150.10:/exports/airflow-data /mnt/airflow-data
#
# Add to /etc/fstab for persistent mount:
#   10.150.150.10:/exports/airflow-data /mnt/airflow-data nfs defaults,_netdev 0 0
